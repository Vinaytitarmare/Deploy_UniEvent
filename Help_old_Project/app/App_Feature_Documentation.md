# centralized-event-platform - Application Documentation

## Overview
This application is a comprehensive Event Management Platform designed for University Students, Club Owners, and Administrators. It facilitates event discovery, registration (RSVP), management, and analytics with a modern, dynamic user interface.

## Problem Statement & Value Proposition
*   **The Need**:
    *   **Fragmented Information**: Students often miss events because details are scattered across emails, WhatsApp groups, and notice boards.
    *   **Scheduling Conflicts**: Without calendar integration, students frequently double-book or forget online sessions.
    *   **Blindspots for Clubs**: Organizers lack data on *who* is attending (e.g., "Are we reaching enough 1st-year CSE students?") and cannot track long-term engagement trends.
    *   **Accessibility Barriers**: Finding a specific Meet link at the last minute is often stressful and difficult.
*   **The Solution**:
    *   A centralized hub that syncs directly with **Google Calendar** for seamless reminders.
    *   **AI-Powered Assistance** via Gemini to instantly retrieve schedules and links.
    *   **Granular Analytics** that empower clubs to refine their promotion strategies based on real data (Branch-wise trends, participation heatmaps).

## 1. Authentication & User Mangement
### Features
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    *   **Student**: Can browse events, RSVP, set reminders, and manage their profile.
    *   **Club Owner**: Includes Student privileges + can Create Events, Manage "My Events", and View Analytics.
    *   **Admin**: Superuser privileges. Can manage ALL events, Suspend/Unsuspend events, and access a dedicated Control Panel.
*   **Multi-Account Support**:
    *   **Switch Accounts**: Users can save multiple login credentials and switch between them instantly from the Profile screen without re-entering passwords.
    *   **Secure Storage**: Credentials are securely stored using `expo-secure-store`.
*   **Sign Up / Login**:
    *   Email/Password authentication via Firebase Auth.
    *   Automatic role assignment (defaults to Student, upgradeable via Admin/Database).

## 2. Dynamic Home Screen (User Feed)
