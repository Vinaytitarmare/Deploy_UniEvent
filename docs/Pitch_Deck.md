## Slide 1: The Problem
**Title**: Campus Events are Chaos
-   **Point 1**: Message spam on WhatsApp groups.
-   **Point 2**: Missed opportunities due to lost announcements.
-   **Point 3**: No centralized tracking for club performance.

## Slide 2: The Solution
**Title**: One Platform for Everything
-   **Visual**: Screenshot of "User Feed" and "Admin Dashboard".

-   **Impact**: Targeted notifications, Reminders, and Analytics.

## Slide 3: How It Works
**Title**: Seamless Flow
1.  **Club Creates Event** -> Sets Target (e.g., CSE Dept).
2.  **System Notifies** -> Only CSE students get alerts.
3.  **Student Engages** -> Sets Reminder, Attends.
4.  **Club Gains Reputation** -> Points awarded for success.

## Slide 4: Key Features
**Title**: Feature Stack
-   **Responsive Admin UI**: Manage on the go or at a desk.
